        and for the rights granted to the Company. You will not be reimbursed

      <p>
        13. <u>Dispute Resolution</u>.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.1. <u>Generally</u>. In the interest of resolving disputes between
        you and the Company in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and
        except as described in Section 13.3, you and the Company agree that
        every dispute arising in connection with: (i) these Creator Terms; (ii)
        your use of or interaction with the Platform; or (iii) any data or
        information you may provide to the Company or that the Company may
        gather in connection with such use, interaction or transaction will be
        resolved by confidential binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal
        than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead
        of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court,
        and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can
        award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement
        to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to
        any aspect of these Creator Terms, whether based in contract, tort,
        statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and
        regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of
        these Creator Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          13.2. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU
          AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO
          PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        13.3. <u>Exceptions</u>. Despite the provisions of Sections 13.1 and
        13.2, nothing in these Creator Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude,
        or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual
        action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through
        the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is
        available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of
        arbitration; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an
        intellectual property infringement claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.4. <u>Arbitrator</u>. Any arbitration between you and the Company
        will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by
        the American Arbitration Association (the &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) under its
        Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the &ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;)
        as modified by these Creator Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are
        available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879,
        or by contacting the Company. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to
        resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or
        enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.5. <u>Notice of Arbitration; Process</u>. A party who intends to seek
        arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other
        party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required)
        or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical
        address, then by electronic mail with confirmation or acknowledgement of
        receipt by the recipient (the &ldquo;Notice of Arbitration&rdquo;). The
        Company&rsquo;s address for Notice of Arbitration is: MD Distribution
        LLC, ATTN: Legal Department, 8 Lombardy Street #40822 Newark, New Jersey
        07102. The Notice of Arbitration must: (i) describe the nature and basis
        of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought
        (the &ldquo;Demand&rdquo;). The parties will make good faith efforts to
        resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement
        to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you
        or the Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration
        proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise
        agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of
        any settlement offer made by you or the Company must not be disclosed to
        the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and
        award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the
        last written settlement amount offered by the Company in settlement of
        the dispute prior to the award, the Company will pay to you the higher
        of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.6. <u>Fees</u>. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these
        Creator Terms, the Company will reimburse you for your payment of the
        filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case
        the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any
        arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in
        Newark, New Jersey, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may
        choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the
        basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a
        non-appearance based telephone or virtual hearing; or (iii) by an
        in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or
        parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the
        substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous
        or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set
        forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all
        fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to
        reimburse the Company for all monies previously disbursed by it that are
        otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the
        arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain
        the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award,
        if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes
        as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time
        during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14
        days of the arbitrator&rsquo;s ruling on the merits.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.7 <u>No Class Actions</u>. YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY
        BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY
        AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
        REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, unless both you and the Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator
        may not consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims, and may not
        otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.8. <u>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</u>. If the Company
        makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a
        change to the Company&rsquo;s address for Notice of Arbitration, you may
        reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the
        change to the Company&rsquo;s address for Notice of Arbitration, in
        which case these Creator Terms will be immediately terminated and this
        arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you
        rejected, will survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        13.9. <u>Enforceability</u>. If Section 13.7 is found to be
        unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 13 is found to be
        unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 13 will be null and
        void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive
        jurisdiction and venue described in Section 15.2 will govern any action
        arising out of or related to these Creator Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        14. <u>Remedies</u>. Your rights and remedies in the event of any breach
        by the Company of these Creator Terms or any of the Company&rsquo;s
        obligations hereunder shall be limited to your right to recover damages,
        if any, in action at law, and you hereby waive any right or remedy in
        equity, including, any right to terminate or rescind these Creator Terms
        or any other right granted to the Company hereunder and/or to seek
        injunctive or other equitable relief with respect to any breach of the
        Company&rsquo;s obligations hereunder and/or to enjoin or restrain or
        otherwise impair the Platform or the Creator Portal, or any parts or
        elements thereof, or the use, publication or dissemination of any
        advertising in connection therewith.

        consent; any assignment or transfer in violation of this Section 15.1
        shall be null and void. We may assign these Creator Terms at any time
        without notice or consent. We will not be liable for any delay or
        failure to perform resulting from causes outside our reasonable control,
        including acts of God, health pandemics (such as COVID-19), war,

        fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation
        facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials. The failure to require
        performance of any provision will not affect our right to require
        performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any
        breach or default of these Creator Terms, or any provision of these
        Creator Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a
        waiver of the provision itself.
