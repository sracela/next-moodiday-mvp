      <p>Effective date: November 14, 2022</p>
      <p>
        Welcome to Moodi Day. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions
        that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and
        applications (the “Services”). If you have any questions, comments, or
        concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at
        info@moodiday.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and
        MD DIstribution LLC dba Moodi Day (“Moodi Day,” “we” and “us”). You must
        agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use
        the Services in any manner. Your using the Services in any way means
        that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in
        effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in
        this document, as well as those in the Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        ARBITRATION NOTICE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER: EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF
        DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE ARBITRATION SECTION BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT
        DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL
        ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION
        LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your use of or participation in certain Services may be subject to
        additional policies, rules and/or conditions (“Additional Terms”) which
        are incorporated herein by reference, and you understand and agree that
        by using or participating in any such Services, you agree to also comply
        with these Additional Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Will these Terms ever change?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may
        need to change along with our Services. We reserve the right to change
        the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will place a notice on the
        moodiday.com website, send you an email, and/or notify you by some other
        means.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them;
        unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the
        Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms
        is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or
        modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and
        signed by both you and us.

        Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant

        that any representation or warranty made by you pursuant to these Terms

        <b>What are my rights in the Services?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the

        descriptions, biographies, user demographics, and any other information,

        Submissions, and so forth (all of the foregoing, the “Content”) are
        protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You
        promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information,
        and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the
        Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate,
        publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display,
        license, sell, commercialize or otherwise exploit for any purpose any
        Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of
        that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including
        Moodi Day’s) rights.
      </p>

        You understand that Moodi Day owns the Services. You won’t modify,

        based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please
        remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that
        all the restrictions above don’t apply — they do!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Do I have to grant any licenses to Moodi Day or to other users?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through
        the Services is your “User Submission.” Some User Submissions may be
        viewable by other users. In order to display your User Submissions on
        the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable),
        you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions. Please note that
        all of the following licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy to the
        extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your
        personally-identifiable information.
      </p>
      <p>
        For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Moodi Day a license to
        translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example, making sure your
        content is viewable on a mobile device as well as a computer) and
        reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in
        each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more
        detail below. This is a license only — your ownership in User
        Submissions is not affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a
        manner that more than just you or certain specified users can view, or
        if you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any feedback,
        suggestions, improvements, enhancements, and/or feature requests
        relating to the Services (each of the foregoing, a “Public User
        Submission”), then you grant Moodi Day the licenses above, as well as a
        license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission
        for the purpose of making that Public User Submission accessible to all
        Moodi Day users and providing the Services necessary to do so, as well
        as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that
        Public User Submission in connection with the Services and/or otherwise
        in connection with Moodi Day’s business for any purpose. Also, you grant
        all other users of the Services a license to access that Public User
        Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by
        the functionality of the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual,
        sublicensable, irrevocable, and worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, you understand and agree that Moodi Day, in performing the
        required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including
        you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and
        adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection
        networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses
        include the rights to do so.

        You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”),
        as it relates to online service providers, like Moodi Day, being asked

        1. Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements. If you believe that
        material or content residing on or accessible through the Services
        infringes your copyright (or the copyright of someone whom you are
        authorized to act on behalf of), please send a notice of copyright
        infringement containing the following information to the Moodi Day
        Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (our
        “Designated Agent,” whose contact details are listed below):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          (a) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act
          on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly
          infringed;
        </li>
        <li>(b) Identification of works or materials being infringed;</li>
        <li>
          (c) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing
          including information regarding the location of the infringing
          materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with
          sufficient detail so that Moodi Day is capable of finding and
          verifying its existence;
        </li>
        <li>
          (d) Contact information about the notifier including address,
          telephone number and, if available, email address;
        </li>
        <li>
          (e) A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the
          material identified in (1)(c) is not authorized by the copyright
          owner, its agent, or the law;
        </li>
        <li>
          (f) A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information
          provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the
          complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.

      </ul>
      <p>
        2. Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the
        Designated Agent. Upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright
        infringement, we reserve the right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>(a) remove or disable access to the infringing material;</li>
        <li>
          {" "}
          (b) notify the content provider who is accused of infringement that we
          have removed or disabled access to the applicable material;
        </li>
        <li>
          (c) terminate such content provider’s access to the Services if he or
          she is a repeat offender.
        </li>

        3. Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent. If the
        content provider believes that the material that was removed (or to
        which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider
        believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the
        copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or, pursuant to the law,
        the content provider may send us a counter-notice containing the
        following information to the Designated Agent:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>(a) A physical or electronic signature of the content provider;</li>
        <li>
          (b) Identification of the material that has been removed or to which
          access has been disabled and the location at which the material
          appeared before it was removed or disabled;
        </li>
        <li>
          (c) A statement that the content provider has a good faith belief that
          the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or
          misidentification of the material;
        </li>
        <li>
          (d) Content provider’s name, address, telephone number, and, if
          available, email address, and a statement that such person or entity
          consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial
          district in which the content provider’s address is located, or, if
          the content provider’s address is located outside the United States,
          for any judicial district in which Moodi Day is located, and that such
          person or entity will accept service of process from the person who
          provided notification of the alleged infringement. If a counter-notice
          is received by the Designated Agent, Moodi Day may, in its discretion,
          send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party
          informing that person that Moodi Day may replace the removed material
          or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner
          files an action seeking a court order against the content provider
          accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be
          replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more
          after receipt of the counter-notice, at Moodi Day’s discretion.
        </li>

        You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to
        the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights
        necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You will

        responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or
        services that are not owned or controlled by Moodi Day. When you access
        third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there
        are risks in doing so, and that Moodi Day is not responsible for such
        risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to
        read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third-party
        website or service that you visit or utilize.

        users and any third party, you agree that Moodi Day is under no

        says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor
        does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of
        executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have
        materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Will Moodi Day ever change the Services?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re always trying to improve our Services, so they may change over
        time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may
        introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict
        access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice
        when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely
        affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the
        right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any
        reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you
        contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole
        discretion, and without notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Do the Services cost anything?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Services may be free or we may charge a fee for using the Services.
        If you are using a free version of the Services, we will notify you
        before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you
        wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees
        for such Services. Note that if you elect to receive text messages
        through the Services, data and message rates may apply. Any and all such
        charges, fees or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult
        with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees or
        costs may apply to your use of the Services.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          (a) <b>Paid Services.</b> Certain of our Services may be subject to
          payments now or in the future (the “Paid Services”). Please note that
          any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing
          up for a Paid Service are deemed part of these Terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          (b) <b>Billing.</b> We use a third-party payment processor (the
          “Payment Processor”) to bill you through a payment account linked to
          your account on the Services (your “Billing Account”) for use of the
          Paid Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the
          terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in
          addition to these Terms. We are not responsible for error by the
          Payment Processor. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay
          us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in
          effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the
          applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment
          Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment
          Method”). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment
          Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that
          the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or
          received payment.
        </li>
        <li>
          (c) <b>Payment Method.</b> The terms of your payment will be based on
          your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you
          and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of
          your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do
          not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your
          Billing Account upon demand.
        </li>
        <li>
          (d) <b>Recurring Billing.</b> Some of the Paid Services may consist of
          an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by
          recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring
          payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and
          recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all
          recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC
          CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL
          YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT
          YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT
          METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE
          REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR
          PAYMENT METHOD, PLEASE CONTACT US AT info@moodiday.com.
        </li>
        <li>
          (e) <b>Current Information Required.</b>YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT,
          COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST
          PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT,
          COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT
          CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY
          NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED
          (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH
          OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER
          NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE BY
          CONTACTING YOUR ACCOUNT MANAGER AT info@moodiday.com. IF YOU FAIL TO
          PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY
          CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING
          ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH
          ABOVE.
        </li>
        <li>
          (f) <b>Change in Amount Authorized.</b> If the amount to be charged to
          your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other
          than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales
          taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of
          the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the
          scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your
          payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You
          agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one
          or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.
        </li>
        <li>
          (g) <b>Auto-Renewal for Paid Services.</b> Unless you opt out of
          auto-renewal, which can be done by contacting us at info@moodiday.com,
          any Paid Services you have signed up for will be automatically
          extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the
          subscription term originally selected, at the then-current
          non-promotional rate. To change or resign your Paid Services at any
          time, please contact us at info@moodiday.com. If you terminate a Paid
          Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your
          then-current term and your subscription will not be renewed after your
          then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a
          prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the
          then-current subscription period. If you do not want to continue to be
          charged on a recurring monthly basis, you must cancel the applicable
          Paid Service BY CONTACTING US AT info@mooodiday.com or terminate your
          Moodi Day account before the end of the recurring TERM. Paid Services
          cannot be terminated before the end of the period for which you have
          already paid, and except as expressly provided in these terms, Moodi
          Day will not refund any fees that you have already paid.
        </li>
        <li>
          (h)<b> Reaffirmation of Authorization. </b>Your non-termination or
          continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to
          charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those
          charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This
          does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your
          charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as
          otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid
          Service. Free Trials and Other Promotions. Any free trial or other
          promotion that provides access to a Paid Service must be used within
          the specified time of the trial. You must stop using a Paid Service
          before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for
          that Paid Service.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>What if I want to stop using the Services?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        You’re free to do that at any time, by contacting us at
        info@moodiday.com; please refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the
        licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us
        after you have stopped using our Services. Moodi Day is also free to
        terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your
        account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of
        these Terms. Moodi Day has the sole right to decide whether you are in
        violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated
        with your account, including assessments, reports, questionnaires, and
        job listings, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your
        account. We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our
        terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important
        User Submissions you may have stored in your account (to the extent
        allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it
        would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone’s safety
        or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of Moodi
        Day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these
        Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following
        will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify
        us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or
        intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us,
        including without limitation the arbitration agreement.

          party using your account), and
        </li>
        <li>
          (b) your violation of these Terms. In the event of such a claim, suit,
          or action (“Claim”), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to
          the contact information we have for your account (provided that
          failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your

          hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law
          or otherwise) without Moodi Day’s prior written consent. We may
          transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and
          obligations without consent.

          <i>Choice of Law.</i> These Terms are governed by and will be

        Arbitration Agreement. Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
        carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and
        claims with Moodi Day and limits the manner in which you can seek relief
        from Moodi Day. Both you and Moodi Day acknowledge and agree that for
        the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject
        matter of these Terms, Moodi Day’s officers, directors, employees and
        independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third party beneficiaries of
        these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel
        will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to
        enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.
      </p>
      <p>
        (a) Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. Any
        dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms
        shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in New York, New York.
        The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with
        the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then
        in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in
        resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who
        shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in
        accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such
        arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each
        party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable
        relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>(b) Costs of Arbitration.</i> The Rules will govern payment of all
        arbitration fees. Moodi Day will pay all arbitration fees for claims
        less than ten thousand ($10,000) dollars. Moodi Day will not seek its
        attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator
        determines that your claim is frivolous.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>(c) Small Claims Court. </i> Furthermore, either you or Moodi Day may
        assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New York, New
        York or any United States county where you live or work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>(d) Waiver of Jury Trial. </i> YOU AND MOODI DAY WAIVE ANY
        CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN
        FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Moodi Day are instead choosing to have
        claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are
        typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules
        applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.
        In any litigation between you and Moodi Day over whether to vacate or
        enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND MOODI DAY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A
        JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a
        judge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>(e) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</i> ALL CLAIMS AND
        DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE
        ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.
        CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR
        LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR
        USER. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed
        invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Moodi Day is entitled to
        arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court
        as set forth in (g) below.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>(f) Opt-out.</i> You have the right to opt out of the provisions of
        this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to
        the following address: Moodi Day, 8 Lombardy Street #40822, Newark, New
        Jersey 07102, postmarked within 30 days of first accepting these Terms.
        You must include (i) your name and residence address; (ii) the email
        address and/or telephone number associated with your account; and (iii)
        a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms’ arbitration
        agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>(g) Exclusive Venue. </i> If you send the opt-out notice in (f),
        and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement
        permits either you or Moodi Day to litigate any dispute arising out of
        or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the
        foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party and both
        you and Moodi Day agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small
        claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located
        in the State of New Jersey.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>(h) Severability. </i> If the prohibition against class actions and
        other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found
        to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this
        Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement
        will survive the termination of your relationship with Moodi Day.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Miscellaneous.</i> You will be responsible for paying, withholding,
        filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental
        assessments associated with your activity in connection with the
        Services, provided that Moodi Day may, in its sole discretion, do any of
        the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. The failure
        of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not
        be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of
        these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will
        be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these
        Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
        You and Moodi Day agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive
        statement of the mutual understanding between you and Moodi Day, and
        that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral
        agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the
        subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you
        are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Moodi Day, and
        you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Moodi Day in any
        respect whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
        You and Moodi Day agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended
        under these Terms.
