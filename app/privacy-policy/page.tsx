      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Effective date: February 20, 2022</p>
      <p>
        We at Moodi Day know you care about how your personal information is
        used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the
        following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.{" "}
        <b>
          By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that
          you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy,
          and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your
          information in the following ways.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember that your use of Moodi Day’s Services is at all times subject
        to the Terms of Use, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms
        we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given
        to them in the Terms of Use.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable
        information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are
        accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies
        we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage, including any
        third-party employers. We gather various types of Personal Information
        from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this
        Personal Information internally in connection with our Services,
        including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow
        you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other
        users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain services, and
        to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share
        some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described
        below.
      </p>
      <p>
        As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit
        personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under
        13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any
        personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have
        collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete
        that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child
        under age 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact
        us at info@moodiday.com.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Will Moodi Day ever change this Privacy Policy?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to
        change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will place
        a notice on the moodiday.com website, send you an email, and/or notify
        you by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive
        legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email
        address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the
        Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding
        them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy
        have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What Information does Moodi Day Collect?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Information You Provide to Us:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For
        example, when you create an account, complete an assessment, or
        otherwise use the Services, we may collect Personal Information such as
        your name, email address, phone number, educational background, work
        history, resume data, demographics, information about your interests,
        skills, personality, attitudes and knowledge, information about your
        business, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in
        credentials for LinkedIn or other third-party sites). If you provide
        your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the
        Services through a third party site or service, you understand some
        content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account
        Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us, and that
        Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered
        by this Privacy Policy; for example, the basic profile information we
        receive from LinkedIn about you, including your name, location,
        industry, professional history, and number of connections is Third Party
        Account Information covered by this Privacy Policy. Certain information
        may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our
        features. You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you,
        and by creating an account on the Services and providing Personal
        Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and
        therefore may not be anonymous.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some features of the Services allow you to provide content to the
        Services, such as written assessments, information about your interests,
        skills, personality, attitudes and knowledge, comments, information
        about your business, and detailed educational and work profiles. All
        content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us
        indefinitely, even after you terminate your account. We may continue to
        disclose such content to third parties as described in this Privacy
        Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so.
        For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you
        promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, recommend
        certain job opportunities or services, or email you about your use of
        the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email
        from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you
        more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive
        communications from us, please indicate your preference by sending an
        email to info@moodiday.com with the subject line “Unsubscribe”.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Information Collected Automatically</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and
        record information on our server logs from your br /owser or device,
        which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device
        identification, “cookie” information, the type of br /owser and/or
        device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you
        requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your br /owser or
        device that allow us to recognize your br /owser or device and tell us
        how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how
        many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your br /owser
        or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but
        this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you click on a link to a third-party website or service, a third
        party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does
        not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t
        responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware
        that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your
        activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third
        parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your br
        /owser or device.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you
        might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve
        the Services — for example, this data can tell us how often users use a
        particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to
        make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Through cookies we place on your br /owser or device, we may collect
        information about your online activity after you leave our Services.
        Just like any other usage information we collect, this information
        allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience,
        and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your br /owser may
        offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to
        operators of websites and web applications and services (including
        behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to
        track certain of your online activities over time and across different
        websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this
        time, which means that we may collect information about your online
        activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our
        Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Will Moodi Day Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Employers:</b> The Personal Information you provide to us is used to
        identify your unique traits, competencies and preferences to match you
        with employers. As a result, the Personal Information you provide is
        shared with employers who have decided to use our Services. In the event
        that an employer determines it wishes to contact you, that employer can
        use the Personal Information you provided to us to contact you directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree that any Personal Information that you provide to us is at
        your own risk. We cannot control third parties’ access to such
        information from our database.
      </p>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices
        of third parties that we do not own or control, including employers. We
        do not control how any third party may use or disclose your Personal
        Information. Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it
        to other individuals or entities without our control and without your
        knowledge, and search engines may index that information. Because of
        this, despite commercially reasonable efforts, we cannot guarantee the
        privacy of Personal Information submitted by you. Also note that if you
        exchange messages with a potential employer to whom you were introduced
        through us, such employer may retain the message history after you
        terminate communications and/or close your account on the Services. We
        therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific
        information you may deem private before you submit it through the
        Services or in correspondence with any third party.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Information that’s been de-identified:</b> We may de-identify your
        Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual,
        and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide
        aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to
        collect that information from you), who may use such information to
        understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that
        they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However,
        we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a
        partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner
        that would identify you as an individual person.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Analytics Services:</b> To support and enhance the Services, we use
        third-party analytics services including those provided by Google Inc.
        (“Google”) to analyze how you interact and engage with the Services so
        that we can learn and make enhancements to offer you a better
        experience. Google uses cookies, web beacons and/or other technologies
        to collect information about your use of the Services and other
        websites, and they may track your activity on the Services and other
        websites over time. Information collected by Google may include your IP
        address, web br /owser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked
        and conversion information. Google uses cookies in connection with its
        Google Analytics services. Google’s ability to use and share information
        collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services is
        subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy
        Policy. You have the option to opt out of Google’s use of cookies by
        visiting the Google advertising opt-out page at{" "}

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Affiliated Businesses:</b> In certain situations, businesses or
        third-party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products
        or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either
        alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business
        is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your
        Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent
        that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control
        over the policies and practices of third-party websites or businesses as
        to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any
        transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business,
        please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Agents:</b> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on
        our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide
        products or services to you; for example, we may use a payment
        processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions
        for us. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right
        to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is
        necessary to assist us.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Business Transfers:</b> We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may
        share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the
        evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our
        assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or
        go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be
        one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Protection of Company and Others:</b> We reserve the right to access,
        read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is
        necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms
        of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety
        of Company, our employees, our users, or others.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Is Personal Information about me secure?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        We endeavor to protect the privacy of your Personal Information we hold
        in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete
        security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and
        other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any
        time.
      </p>
      <p>What Personal Information can I access?</p>
      <p>
        The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the
        Services change. If you have any questions about viewing or updating
